#### 1. Design a Parking Lot

* **Requirements:**
    * The parking lot can have multiple floors and different types of parking spots (e.g., small, medium, large).
    * It should support different vehicle types (e.g., car, motorcycle, truck).
    * The system should be able to park a vehicle, unpark a vehicle, and show available spots.
    * It should handle ticket generation and payment.

* **Plan:**
    * **Entities:** `ParkingLot`, `Floor`, `ParkingSpot` (with subtypes for different sizes), `Vehicle` (with subtypes), `Ticket`, `Gate` (for entry and exit), `Payment`.
    * **Relationships:** `ParkingLot` contains `Floors`. Each `Floor` has many `ParkingSpots`. `Ticket` is associated with a `Vehicle` and a `ParkingSpot`. `Payment` processes the `Ticket`.
    * **Design Patterns:**
        * **Strategy:** Use a `ParkingStrategy` interface to define different parking logic (e.g., `FirstAvailableStrategy`).
        * **Factory:** A `VehicleFactory` could create different types of `Vehicle` objects.

#### 2. Design a Vending Machine

* **Requirements:**
    * The machine should have a selection of products with prices and quantities.
    * It should accept currency (e.g., coins, notes).
    * The user can select a product, insert money, and receive the product and change.
    * It should handle out-of-stock products and insufficient funds.

* **Plan:**
    * **Entities:** `VendingMachine`, `Product`, `Coin`, `Note`, `Inventory`, `State` (e.g., `IdleState`, `SelectionState`, `DispensingState`).
    * **Relationships:** `VendingMachine` has an `Inventory` of `Products` and a list of accepted `Coins` and `Notes`. The machine's behavior is defined by its `State`.
    * **Design Patterns:**
        * **State:** This is the most crucial pattern here. The vending machine's behavior changes based on its current state.
        * **Singleton:** The `VendingMachine` could be a Singleton to ensure only one instance.

#### 3. Design a Movie Ticket Booking System

* **Requirements:**
    * Users can search for movies by name, genre, etc.
    * They can view showtimes and available seats for a specific movie and theater.
    * Users can select seats and book tickets.
    * The system should handle concurrency and prevent overbooking.

* **Plan:**
    * **Entities:** `Movie`, `Theater`, `Showtime`, `Seat`, `Booking`, `User`.
    * **Relationships:** `Movie` can be shown in multiple `Theaters`. Each `Theater` has many `Showtime`s. A `Showtime` has a collection of `Seats`. A `Booking` is associated with a `User`, a `Showtime`, and specific `Seats`.
    * **Concurrency:** Use a `Lock` or similar mechanism to ensure that when a seat is being selected or booked, it's not available to other users.
    * **Design Patterns:**
        * **Observer:** A `SeatObserver` could notify clients if a seat becomes unavailable.
        * **Facade:** A `BookingFacade` could provide a simple API for users to interact with the complex booking process.

#### 4. Design a Caching System (e.g., LRU Cache)

* **Requirements:**
    * The cache should have a fixed capacity.
    * It should support `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` operations.
    * When the cache is full and a new item needs to be added, the Least Recently Used (LRU) item should be evicted.

* **Plan:**
    * **Data Structures:**
        * **`HashMap`:** To store key-value pairs for quick lookups ($O(1)$). The value in the hash map will be a reference to a node in a linked list.
        * **`Doubly LinkedList`:** To maintain the order of usage. The most recently used items are at the head, and the least recently used are at the tail.
    * **Plan:**
        * `get(key)`: If the key exists in the `HashMap`, move its corresponding node to the head of the `Doubly LinkedList` and return the value. If not, return `null`.
        * `put(key, value)`: If the key already exists, update its value and move the node to the head. If it's a new key, check if the cache is full. If so, evict the tail node from both the `HashMap` and the `Doubly LinkedList`. Then, add the new node to the head and the `HashMap`.

#### 5. Design a Rate Limiter

* **Requirements:**
    * Limit the number of requests a user can make to a service within a given time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
    * The system should be scalable and work in a distributed environment.

* **Plan:**
    * **Algorithm:** The most common approach is the **Token Bucket Algorithm**.
        * A bucket has a fixed capacity.
        * Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate.
        * Each incoming request consumes a token.
        * If the bucket is empty, the request is rejected.
    * **Plan:**
        * Use a distributed cache like Redis to store the number of tokens for each user.
        * A background process can add tokens to each user's bucket at a regular interval.
        * When a request comes in, check the user's token count in the cache. If it's greater than 0, decrement it and allow the request. Otherwise, reject it.
