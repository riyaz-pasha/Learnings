**Prompt:**

Design a system for `[Your LLD Question Here]`.

Please provide a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) plan, breaking down the solution into the following sections:

1.  **Requirements:**
    * List the key functional and non-functional requirements.
    * State any assumptions you are making.

2.  **Core Entities and Relationships:**
    * Identify the main classes or objects in the system.
    * Describe the relationships between these entities (e.g., composition, aggregation, inheritance).
    * A simple class diagram or description of the relationships would be helpful.

3.  **Data Structures and Algorithms:**
    * Specify the key data structures you would use to implement the system and justify your choices.
    * Outline any specific algorithms (e.g., for searching, sorting, or concurrency) that would be essential.

4.  **Design Patterns:**
    * Identify which design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, State) would be applicable and explain where and why you would use them.

5.  **Concurrency and Scalability:**
    * Discuss how you would handle potential concurrency issues, especially in a multi-user or distributed environment.
    * Briefly mention any considerations for making the system scalable.

6.  **API/Method Signatures:**
    * Provide a few example public method signatures for the main classes to illustrate the public interface of the system.
