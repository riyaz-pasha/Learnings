### 1\. Restaurant Registration Flow

This flow covers the process of a new restaurant signing up and getting approved by the platform.

#### **High-Level Flow**

1.  **Restaurant Initiates Signup:** A new restaurant user downloads the partner app and fills out the registration form with their details.
2.  **API Call:** The app makes a `POST` request to the backend service to create the restaurant profile.
3.  **Data Processing:** The backend service validates the data, uploads the logo to cloud storage, and saves the restaurant's details to the database with a `PENDING_VERIFICATION` status.
4.  **Verification:** An internal admin or an automated system reviews the submitted documents (like the business license) to verify the restaurant's legitimacy.
5.  **Status Update:** Once approved, the admin updates the restaurant's status to `ACTIVE`. If rejected, the status becomes `REJECTED`, and the restaurant is notified.
6.  **Restaurant Goes Live:** The restaurant can now log in, set up their menu, and make their profile public, changing their operational status to `ONLINE`.

### 2\. Menu Management Flow

This flow details how a restaurant can create, update, and manage their food menu.

#### **High-Level Flow**

1.  **Restaurant Accesses Menu:** A logged-in restaurant owner navigates to the "Menu Management" section in their app.
2.  **Create/Update Item:** They add a new dish by filling in details like name, price, and category. They also upload an image of the dish.
3.  **API Call:** The app sends a `POST` or `PUT` request to the backend, including the item details.
4.  **Data Processing:** The backend service processes the image (resizing, compressing) and saves it to cloud storage. It then stores the menu item data in the database, linking it to the restaurant's ID.
5.  **Availability Toggle:** For a quick update, the restaurant can simply flip a switch to mark an item as "out of stock." This sends a `PATCH` request to update the item's availability status in the database.
6.  **Public Sync:** The updated menu is now available for customers to view and order. A caching layer is often used here to ensure fast retrieval.

\<br\>

**APIs**

  * **`POST /restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu/items`**

      * **Description:** Adds a new menu item.
      * **Request Body:**
        ```json

        }
        ```
      * **Response:**
          * **`201 Created`:** Returns the newly created item's ID.
          * **`400 Bad Request`:** For invalid data.

  * **`PUT /restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu/items/{itemId}`**

      * **Description:** Updates an existing menu item.
      * **Request Body:** Same as the POST request, but only required fields need to be sent.

  * **`PATCH /restaurants/{restaurantId}/menu/items/{itemId}/availability`**

      * **Description:** Toggles an item's availability status.
      * **Request Body:**

### 3\. User Home Screen and Search Flow

Your proposed flow is a solid, scalable design. It correctly separates concerns between services and uses an efficient search index. Here are the updates and missing details to make the flow more robust and complete.

-----
-----

### Refined User Home Screen and Search Flow

#### **High-Level Flow**

1.  **App Launch & Location Capture:** A user opens the app. The app requests and captures their current location (latitude and longitude).
2.  **Initial Search Request:** The app sends a request with the user's location to the **Search Service**.
3.  **Geospatial Query:** The **Search Service** doesn't just use TF-IDF, it executes a **geospatial query** on the search index (like Elasticsearch). This query finds all restaurants within a specified radius (e.g., 5-10 km) of the user's coordinates.
4.  **Ranked Results:** The search index returns a list of restaurants. The Search Service then applies a **ranking algorithm** to sort these results based on relevance. This ranking can consider factors like the restaurant's rating, distance, popularity, and whether they are currently open.
5.  **Data Enrichment:** The Search Service may need to fetch additional, up-to-the-minute data from other services, such as the restaurant's current operational status (`ONLINE` or `OFFLINE`) and estimated delivery time.
6.  **Display on Home Screen:** The Search Service returns a refined list of restaurants to the user's app, which then displays them on the home screen.

\<br\>

#### **Missing Details & Updates**

**1. Data Ingestion & Search Indexing**

  * **Triggering the Event:** Whenever a restaurant is **onboarded, updated**, or its **menu changes**, the **Restaurant Service** must publish an event. This event should contain the restaurant's ID and the updated data (e.g., name, address, menu items, ratings).
  * **Message Queue:** The message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) ensures that the event is reliably delivered to the ingestion worker, preventing data loss.
  * **Ingestion Worker:** The worker consumes the event and updates the search index. This process is crucial. The worker must:
      * **Denormalize Data:** Combine restaurant details with menu information and ratings into a single, searchable document. This is key for efficient search.
      * **Index the Data:** Use the appropriate data types for indexing. For example, `lat` and `long` should be indexed as a `geo_point` data type for geospatial queries.

**2. The Search Service**

  * **API Endpoint:** `GET /search/restaurants?lat={latitude}&long={longitude}&radius={radius}&sort_by={ranking_criteria}`
      * Adding `radius` and `sort_by` as optional query parameters gives the user more control and flexibility.
  * **Query Logic:** The service executes a compound query on Elasticsearch, combining:
      * **Geospatial Filter:** A `geo_distance` query to filter restaurants within the specified radius.
      * **Relevance Scoring:** A `should` clause with a `match` query for text searches (restaurant name, dish name) and a `function_score` query to apply ranking boosts.
  * **Handling Text Search:** When a user searches for "pizza" or "Domino's," the same Search Service API is used, but with a different query.
      * `GET /search/restaurants?query=pizza`
      * The Elasticsearch query would now prioritize a text-based search on the indexed restaurant names and menu items, using techniques like fuzzy matching to handle typos.

**3. Data Model for Search Index (Elasticsearch)**

The data stored in the search index should be optimized for fast retrieval.

  * `restaurant_id`: Unique ID.
  * `name`: Restaurant name (text).
  * `location`: `geo_point` data type (`lat`, `long`).
  * `is_open`: Boolean, indicating if they are currently operational.
  * `rating`: Average user rating (float).
  * `popularity_score`: A calculated score based on order volume.
  * `menu_items`: Nested array of objects.
      * `name`: Dish name.
      * `description`: Dish description.
      * `category`: Dish category.
  * `keywords`: An array of words for fuzzy search.

This approach provides a flexible, scalable, and highly performant search experience for the user. It separates the **operational data** (in the primary database) from the **search data** (in the search index), which is a best practice in modern microservices architecture.

### 4\. Cart Management Flow

### Refined Cart Creation, Updation, and Deletion Flow

#### High-Level Flow

1.  **User Adds Item:** A user is viewing a restaurant's menu and taps "Add to Cart" on a specific item.
2.  **API Request:** The app sends a request to the **Cart Service**. This request should include the restaurant ID, user ID, and the details of the item being added, including its ID and quantity.
3.  **Real-Time Validation:** The **Cart Service** first validates the request. It checks if the item is still available and hasn't gone "out of stock" since the menu was loaded. It may also check for any temporary price changes. This is done by communicating with the **Menu Service** or a cached version of the menu data.
4.  **Cart State Management:**
      * **New Cart:** If the user doesn't have an existing cart for that restaurant, the Cart Service creates a new one. It populates the cart with the restaurant ID, user ID, and the added item with its quantity and price.
      * **Existing Cart:** If a cart already exists for that restaurant, the Cart Service updates it by either adding the new item or increasing the quantity of an item that is already there.
5.  **Cart Data Persistence:** The updated cart data is saved to a fast-access database (like Redis or a document database) that can handle high read/write volumes. This allows the user's cart to be retrieved instantly.
6.  **Response to Client:** The Cart Service sends a response back to the app, confirming the successful update and providing the current state of the cart (total items, subtotal, etc.).

-----

### Missing Details & API Refinements

Your initial API `POST /cart` is too generic. It should be more specific and include detailed information about the cart item.

  * **API for Adding/Updating a Cart:**

      * **Endpoint:** `POST /carts` or `PUT /carts/items` (a more RESTful approach).
      * **Description:** Adds a new item to the cart or updates the quantity of an existing one.
      * **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "user123",
          "restaurantId": "rest456",
          "itemId": "item789",
          "quantity": 1,
          "specialInstructions": "No onions, please"
        }
        ```
      * **Response:**
          * **`200 OK` or `201 Created`:** Returns the full, updated cart object.
          * **`404 Not Found`:** If the `restaurantId` or `itemId` is invalid.
          * **`410 Gone`:** If the item is "out of stock."

  * **API for Deleting an Item:**

      * **Endpoint:** `DELETE /carts/{cartId}/items/{itemId}`
      * **Description:** Removes a specific item from the cart. If the last item is removed, the cart is deleted.

  * **API for Clearing the Cart:**

      * **Endpoint:** `DELETE /carts/{cartId}`
      * **Description:** Deletes the entire cart.

### Database/Data Model (High-Level)

The data model needs to be more detailed to accommodate all the necessary information. Using a document-based database (like MongoDB or Redis) is highly suitable for this schema because of its flexible structure.

  * **`carts` Collection/Table**
      * `id`: UUID (Primary Key, or `userId` could be the key in Redis for fast lookups).
      * `userId`: UUID.
      * `restaurantId`: UUID.
      * `createdAt`: TIMESTAMP.
      * `updatedAt`: TIMESTAMP.
      * `items`: An array of embedded objects.
          * `itemId`: UUID.
          * `name`: VARCHAR (cached from menu service to avoid extra lookups).
          * `price`: DECIMAL (cached).
          * `quantity`: INTEGER.
          * `specialInstructions`: TEXT.
  * **A user can have only one active cart per restaurant at any given time.** This is a critical business rule to enforce. If a user tries to add an item from a different restaurant, the app should prompt them to either clear the existing cart or start a new order with the new restaurant.

---
---

### Checkout Flow

The checkout flow is a critical multi-step process that finalizes the user's order and initiates the fulfillment process. It involves several services working in concert.

-----

### High-Level Flow

1.  **User Initiates Checkout:** The user reviews their cart and proceeds to the checkout page. The app makes a request to the **Checkout Service** to fetch the final order summary.
2.  **Summary Calculation:** The **Checkout Service** receives the request and performs a final price calculation. This involves calling the **Cart Service** to get the current cart state, and then the **Pricing Service** to apply any discounts, promotions, taxes, and delivery fees.
3.  **Payment Initiation:** The user selects a payment method. The app then sends a request to the **Payment Service** to securely process the transaction with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
4.  **Order Creation:** Once the payment is successful, the **Order Service** creates a new order record. This record captures all the details: user ID, restaurant ID, items, final price, payment details, and delivery address.
5.  **Notifications and Fulfillment:**
      * The **Order Service** sends a confirmation notification to the user.
      * It publishes an event to a message queue to notify the **Restaurant Service** of the new order.
      * It also notifies the **Delivery Service** to start looking for a delivery partner.

-----

### Detailed Flow with APIs

#### **1. Fetching Checkout Summary**

  * **Endpoint:** `GET /checkout/summary`
  * **Description:** Calculates and returns the final pricing breakdown.
  * **Process:**
    1.  The **Checkout Service** takes the `userId` from the request.
    2.  It calls the **Cart Service** to get the cart details (`GET /carts/{userId}`).
    3.  It then calls the **Pricing Service** with the cart's `restaurantId` and `items` to get a breakdown of costs, including:
          * Item Subtotal
          * Discounts (if applicable)
          * Taxes
          * Platform Fee
          * Delivery Fee
          * **Final Payable Amount**
  * **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "restaurantId": "rest123",
      "items": [ ... ],
      "pricing": {
        "subtotal": 500.00,
        "discount": 50.00,
        "tax": 25.00,
        "deliveryFee": 30.00,
        "total": 505.00
      }
    }
    ```

#### **2. Order Creation and Payment**

  * **Endpoint:** `POST /orders`

  * **Description:** This is the most crucial API call in the flow. It's triggered after the user confirms payment.

  * **Process:**

    1.  The app sends the user's details, cart ID, delivery address, and payment token (from the payment gateway) to the **Order Service**.
    2.  The **Order Service** validates the payment token with the **Payment Service** to ensure the transaction was successful.
    3.  It then fetches the cart details and performs a final check on item availability and pricing.
    4.  It creates a new `order` record in the database with a status of `PENDING_RESTAURANT_ACCEPTANCE`.
    5.  It immediately sends a message to a queue (e.g., Kafka) to notify other services. The message contains the `orderId`.

  * **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "userId": "user123",
      "cartId": "cart456",
      "restaurantId": "rest123",
      "deliveryAddress": { ... },
      "paymentToken": "tok_xxxxxxx"
    }
    ```

  * **Response:**

      * **`201 Created`:** On success, returns the `orderId` and a confirmation message.
      * **`400 Bad Request`:** If the payment failed, an item is out of stock, or the address is invalid.

#### **3. Asynchronous Order Fulfillment**

This part of the flow is driven by the event published to the message queue.

  * **Restaurant Notification:** The **Restaurant Service** has a worker that listens for "new order" events. When an event arrives, it updates the restaurant's dashboard and sends a push notification to the restaurant's app, allowing them to accept or reject the order.
  * **Delivery Partner Assignment:** The **Delivery Service** also listens for "new order" events. It uses the `restaurantId` and `deliveryAddress` to find the nearest available delivery partner and assign the order to them.
  * **User Notifications:** The **Notification Service** sends a "Your order has been placed\!" notification to the user, and later, "Your order has been accepted by the restaurant," "Your food is being prepared," etc.

### Database Schemas (High-Level)

  * **`orders` table**
      * `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
      * `userId`: UUID
      * `restaurantId`: UUID
      * `status`: ENUM (`PENDING_RESTAURANT_ACCEPTANCE`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `IN_PREPARATION`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `DELIVERED`, `CANCELLED`)
      * `totalAmount`: DECIMAL
      * `deliveryAddress`: JSONB/TEXT (structured address data)
      * `items`: JSONB (embedded array of item details, including `itemId`, `name`, `quantity`, `price`)
      * `paymentDetails`: JSONB (payment method, transaction ID)
      * `createdAt`: TIMESTAMP
      * `updatedAt`: TIMESTAMP

---
---

### Refined Checkout Flow

#### 1. Checkout Summary & Final Price Calculation

Your flow for the summary page is correct. The `GET /checkout/summary?{cartId}` endpoint is perfect.

* **Final Price & Item Availability:** The `Checkout Service` must perform a **real-time validation** of the cart's contents. It queries the **Menu Service** to confirm each item is still available and its price hasn't changed. This prevents discrepancies between what the user saw earlier and the final cost. If any item is unavailable, the service should return a clear error, and the app must prompt the user to update their cart.

---

#### 2. Order Creation & Payment Intent

This is where your flow gets a bit more complex, which is a good thing.

* **Endpoint:** The `POST /checkout` is a good starting point. Let's refine the name to be more descriptive of its action, such as `POST /orders/checkout`.
* **Cart Locking:** Your idea to **lock the cart** is crucial. This prevents the user from modifying the cart after initiating checkout. The cart status in the database should be updated to `LOCKED` or `CHECKOUT_IN_PROGRESS`.
* **Order Status:** The order entry created in the `orders` table should have a status like `PAYMENT_PENDING` or `CREATED`. This is a crucial state that tells your system the transaction has been initiated but not yet completed.

---

#### 3. Payment Gateway Integration (Refined)

Your understanding of payment intents and client secrets is accurate. Here's a breakdown of the server-to-server and client-to-gateway interactions.

1.  **Server Creates Payment Intent:** The `POST /orders/checkout` endpoint on your `Checkout Service` makes a secure server-to-server call to the payment gateway (e.g., Stripe API). This request includes the final amount, currency, and a unique `orderId` that you generated. The gateway's API key is used here for authentication. The gateway doesn't charge the user yet; it simply reserves the right to charge them.
2.  **Server Responds to Client:** The gateway returns a `paymentIntentId` and a `clientSecret` to your `Checkout Service`. Your service then returns these two pieces of information to the user's device.
3.  **Client-Side Payment Component:** Your user's app (or web page) uses the `paymentIntentId` and `clientSecret` to initialize a client-side payment component provided by the gateway's SDK. This component securely handles the card or UPI details, manages 3D Secure authentication (if required), and communicates directly with the payment gateway.
4.  **Client-Side Confirmation:** Once the payment is completed, the payment gateway's client-side SDK returns a confirmation status to your user's device.

---

#### 4. Payment Confirmation & Order Finalization (The Missing Piece)

This is the most critical part where your system needs to be reliable. You've identified two options—client-side code forwarding and webhooks. **The webhook approach is the industry standard and should be your primary method.**

* **Why Webhooks are Superior:**
    * **Guaranteed Delivery:** A client's internet connection can drop after the payment succeeds but before it sends the confirmation code back to your server. A webhook is a direct, server-to-server communication that is guaranteed to be delivered (or retried by the gateway).
    * **Security:** It eliminates the risk of a malicious client faking a payment confirmation code.
    * **Asynchronous Processing:** It allows you to update the order status and trigger fulfillment processes (like notifying the restaurant) in the background, without delaying the user's experience.

**The Webhook Flow:**
1.  **Payment Gateway Sends Webhook Event:** When the payment status on the gateway changes to `succeeded`, it sends an automated `POST` request to a secure endpoint on your server (e.g., `POST /webhooks/stripe`).
2.  **Webhook Listener Service:** A dedicated **Webhook Listener Service** on your backend receives this request. It verifies the request's authenticity using a secret key provided by the gateway.
3.  **Update Order Status:** The listener service then uses the `paymentIntentId` from the webhook payload to find the corresponding `orderId` in your database. It updates the order status from `PAYMENT_PENDING` to `ACCEPTED`.
4.  **Trigger Fulfillment:** The listener service can then publish an event to a message queue (`ORDER_PAID_SUCCESSFULLY`), triggering downstream processes like:
    * Notifying the restaurant.
    * Notifying the user with an "Order Confirmed!" message.
    * Initiating the delivery partner search.
5.  **Client-Side Fallback:** While this is happening, your app can still show a "Payment processing" screen and then poll an API (`GET /orders/{orderId}/status`) or listen for a push notification from your system to show a "Payment Successful" screen. This provides a good user experience while the backend handles the critical part securely.


----
----

### 1. The Checkout Summary Page

1.  **User Action:** The user, after adding items to their cart, clicks "Proceed to Checkout."
2.  **App Request:** The app makes a `GET` request to the backend: `GET /checkout/summary?cartId={cartId}`. This request tells the system to prepare the final bill.
3.  **Backend Validation & Calculation:**
    * The **Checkout Service** receives the request.
    * It first queries the **Cart Service** to get all items in the user's cart.
    * It then queries the **Restaurant Service** to re-verify the real-time status of each item (e.g., is it still in stock?). If an item is unavailable, the service will return an error to the user.
    * It calculates all charges: base price of items, taxes, delivery fees, and platform charges.
    * It applies any discounts or promotions from the **Promotions Service**.
4.  **Display Summary:** The service sends the final, detailed summary back to the app, which displays it to the user. This includes the subtotal, all fees, discounts, and the final amount due.

***

### 2. Order Creation & Payment Initiation

1.  **User Action:** The user, satisfied with the summary, clicks the "Pay Now" button.
2.  **App Request:** The app sends a `POST` request to create the order: `POST /orders/checkout`. The request body includes the `cartId`, the user's delivery address, and the selected payment method.
3.  **Backend Processing:**
    * The **Order Service** receives the request and **locks the cart** to prevent any further changes.
    * It creates a new entry in the `orders` database with a `PAYMENT_PENDING` status.
    * The service then communicates securely with a third-party payment gateway (like Stripe or Razorpay) using a **server-to-server API call**.
    * The service requests the gateway to create a **Payment Intent**. This is a secure object that represents the intention to collect a specific amount of money from the user.
4.  **Backend Response to App:** The payment gateway doesn't charge the user yet. It returns a `paymentIntentId` and a `clientSecret` to your server. Your server immediately forwards these two pieces of data back to the user's app.

***

### 3. Client-Side Payment Flow

1.  **Payment Component:** The app uses the `paymentIntentId` and `clientSecret` to activate the payment gateway's client-side SDK. This SDK launches a secure, hosted component where the user enters their credit card or other payment details.
2.  **Secure Communication:** The user's device sends the sensitive payment information directly to the payment gateway's servers. **Your server never sees or stores this data.**
3.  **Gateway Authentication:** The gateway handles all security, including card validation and 3D Secure authentication (if required), which may involve redirecting the user to their bank's website to enter a one-time password.
4.  **Client-Side Confirmation:** Once the payment is complete, the payment gateway's SDK sends a signal back to the app, confirming the transaction's success or failure.

***

### 4. Finalizing the Order & Fulfillment (Webhook-based)

This is the most critical part of the flow and relies on a webhook for reliability.

1.  **Gateway Webhook:** When the payment is successfully processed and the user's bank confirms the charge, the payment gateway sends a **webhook event** (a direct `POST` request) to a dedicated, secure endpoint on your server (e.g., `/webhooks/stripe`). This webhook is a guaranteed, server-to-server notification of the payment status.
2.  **Webhook Listener Service:** A service on your backend, the **Webhook Listener**, receives this event. It verifies the request's authenticity and then uses the `paymentIntentId` from the webhook payload to look up the corresponding order in your database.
3.  **Order Status Update:** The listener service updates the order status from `PAYMENT_PENDING` to `ACCEPTED`. It's a definitive sign that the order is paid for and ready for the next steps.
4.  **Asynchronous Fulfillment:** The listener service publishes an event to a message queue (e.g., `ORDER_PAID`). Other services are listening for this event:
    * The **Restaurant Service** gets notified and updates the restaurant's dashboard.
    * The **Notification Service** sends a "Your order is confirmed!" message to the user.
    * The **Delivery Service** starts looking for a delivery partner.

5.  **User Interface Update:** The user's app, which has been showing a "Processing payment..." screen, receives a push notification or polls a status API (`GET /orders/{orderId}`) and transitions to the "Payment Successful" screen. This completes the checkout flow.

Your description of the post-payment order flow is very accurate and aligned with a microservices-based architecture. This is a great plan. Let's refine and add more detail to each step to ensure a robust and scalable system.

### 6. Order Fulfillment and Delivery

The final stage of the order lifecycle begins after successful payment. This phase involves a series of asynchronous events to coordinate the restaurant, the delivery partner, and the customer.

#### 1. Order Confirmation and Restaurant Notification

Your flow starts with the `order.payment.success` event, which is the correct trigger. This event signals that the order is a go.

* **Order Service:** After receiving the `payment.success` webhook from the payment gateway, the **Order Service** updates the order status to `ACCEPTED`. It then publishes the `order.payment.success` event to the message queue.
* **Restaurant Worker:** A dedicated **Restaurant Worker** service listens for this event. It processes the event and pushes the new order to the respective restaurant's dashboard.
* **Real-time Communication:** For notifying the restaurant, **WebSockets** are the best choice for a real-time system. Unlike short-polling, which constantly makes requests, a WebSocket connection stays open, allowing the server to push new orders instantly. The restaurant gets a real-time notification with an audible alert.

#### 2. Restaurant Action & Event Publishing

The restaurant's decision to accept or reject the order is a critical user action.

* **Restaurant Side:** The restaurant views the order details (items, special requests, and time) and either accepts or rejects it.
* **API Call:**
    * **Accept:** `POST /restaurants/{restaurantId}/orders/{orderId}/accept`
    * **Reject:** `POST /restaurants/{restaurantId}/orders/{orderId}/reject`
* **Event Publishing:**
    * **On Acceptance:** The **Restaurant Service** publishes the `order.restaurant.confirmed` event to the message queue. This event is a signal that the food will be prepared.
    * **On Rejection:** The **Restaurant Service** publishes an `order.restaurant.rejected` event. This triggers a refund process and notifies the customer.

#### 3. Delivery Partner Matching and Assignment

This is where the system finds the right person to deliver the food. Your approach of using a dedicated worker and a radius-based search is correct.

* **Matching Worker:** A **Delivery Partner Matching Worker** listens for the `order.restaurant.confirmed` event.
* **Geospatial Query:** The worker queries a geospatial database (like Redis or a dedicated geo-service) that holds real-time delivery partner locations. It fetches all partners within a defined radius (e.g., 5-10 km) of the restaurant. The query should also filter for partners who are currently `AVAILABLE`.
* **Parallel Notification:** Instead of notifying a few partners at a time, a more efficient strategy is to notify a set of partners **simultaneously**. The system sends a push notification to 3-5 of the closest available partners.
* **Assignment Logic:** The first partner to accept the order gets assigned. The other partners who received the notification will get a "This order is no longer available" message when they try to accept it.
* **Event Publishing:** Once a partner is assigned, the **Delivery Partner Service** publishes the `order.deliverypartner.assigned` event.

#### 4. Real-Time Location Tracking

This feature provides the customer with a live view of their order's journey.

* **Location Worker:** A dedicated **Delivery Partner Location Worker** service listens for location updates from the delivery partner's app. This can be done via a WebSocket connection.
* **Database:** This service stores the `partnerId` and `currentLocation` in a highly performant, in-memory database like **Redis**. Redis is excellent for this use case because it can handle a high volume of writes (location updates) and reads (customer app querying the location) with very low latency.
* **Customer App:** The customer's app periodically queries the backend (via an API like `GET /orders/{orderId}/location`) to fetch the delivery partner's current location from Redis and display it on a map. 

This entire chain of events—from payment confirmation to delivery partner assignment and tracking—is a testament to the power of event-driven architecture, ensuring each step is handled efficiently and reliably.
