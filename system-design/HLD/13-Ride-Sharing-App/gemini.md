When a user requests a fare estimate, a series of backend processes are triggered to provide a near-instantaneous and accurate price.

***

### How Fare Estimation Works

1.  **Request Initiation**: The user's app sends a request to the backend with their **source location** (latitude and longitude) and **destination location** (latitude and longitude).

2.  **Route and Distance Calculation**:
    * The backend service uses a **geospatial API** (like Google Maps' Directions API or a similar service) to find the optimal route between the source and destination.
    * This API takes into account real-time traffic, road closures, and one-way streets to calculate the most efficient path.
    * The API returns key data, including the total **driving distance** (in kilometers or miles) and the **estimated travel time** (in minutes). This is a crucial step as it provides the foundation for the fare calculation.

3.  **Fare Components**: The total estimated fare is built from several key components:
    * **Base Fare**: A fixed, flat fee charged for every ride.
    * **Distance Rate**: A cost per unit of distance (e.g., rupees per kilometer) applied to the calculated distance.
    * **Time Rate**: A cost per unit of time (e.g., rupees per minute) applied to the estimated travel time. This component accounts for slow-moving traffic or waiting time.
    * **Surge Pricing Multiplier**: This is a dynamic factor that adjusts the fare based on real-time **supply and demand**. If there are not enough drivers to meet rider requests in a specific area, the system applies a **surge multiplier** (e.g., 1.5x, 2.0x). This multiplier increases the total fare, incentivizing more drivers to go online and move to that area.

4.  **Fare Calculation**: The final estimated fare is calculated using a formula that combines these components:
    
    $$
    \text{Estimated Fare} = (\text{Base Fare} + (\text{Distance} \times \text{Distance Rate}) + (\text{Time} \times \text{Time Rate})) \times \text{Surge Multiplier}
    $$
    

5.  **Response to User**: The calculated estimated fare (often presented as a range to account for potential traffic changes) is sent back to the user's app and displayed on the screen. The user can then decide whether to confirm the ride.

### Updated Ride Confirmation and Driver Matching Flow

This updated flow replaces inefficient polling with a more modern, real-time event-driven architecture using **WebSockets** and **Push Notifications** for a superior user experience.

### Step-by-Step Flow

1.  **Ride Confirmation and Initial Request**
    * The user reviews the fare estimate and clicks "Confirm Ride."
    * The client app sends a `POST` request to the API Gateway:
        * `POST /api/v1/ride-request`
        * Body: `{ riderId: ..., source: {lat, long}, destination: {lat, long} }`
    * The API Gateway forwards this request to the **Ride Service**.

2.  **Ride Service Actions**
    * The **Ride Service** validates the request and creates a new entry in the `rides` table in the database with the following initial state:
        * `id`: unique ride ID
        * `riderId`: user's ID
        * `driverId`: `null` (not yet matched)
        * `source`, `destination`, `distance`, `estimatedEta`: as provided by the fare estimation process.
        * `status`: `riderConfirmed`
    * The Ride Service then publishes a message to a **Message Queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) with the `rideId`.
    * The Ride Service returns a response to the client with the `rideId` and an initial status (e.g., `status: 'findingDriver'`).

3.  **Real-Time Connection Setup (The Key Change)**
    * Upon receiving the response, the rider's app **establishes a WebSocket connection** to the backend, using the `rideId` as an identifier for the session.
    * The UI displays a "Finding Driver..." animation. The app will now wait for a push from the server via this WebSocket connection instead of repeatedly polling.

4.  **Driver Matching Worker**
    * A dedicated **Driver Matching Worker** (a microservice) consumes the `rideId` message from the Message Queue.
    * It queries the **Redis database** for nearby drivers. This database uses **Geo-hashing** to efficiently find all online drivers within a specified radius (e.g., 5 km) of the ride's source location.
    * The worker retrieves a list of the 10-20 closest available drivers.

5.  **Driver Selection and Notification**
    * The worker iterates through the list of nearby drivers.
    * For each driver, it checks their status in Redis to ensure they are `online` and not currently busy with another ride request (`rideRequestSent`) or a live trip.
    * If a driver is available, the worker takes these actions:
        * Updates the driver's status in Redis to `rideRequestSent` to prevent other ride requests from being sent to them.
        * Sends a **Push Notification** (via FCM, APNS) to the driver's app. The notification includes the ride details (rider's location, destination, fare estimate, etc.).
    * The worker sets a timeout (e.g., 20 seconds) for the driver to accept or decline.

6.  **Driver Acceptance**
    * If the driver accepts the ride, their app sends an acceptance message to the **Ride Service**.
    * The Ride Service updates the `rides` table with the `driverId` and changes the `status` to `driverMatched`.
    * The Ride Service (or a separate notification service) then immediately publishes an event to a **real-time message broker**.

7.  **Real-Time Update to Rider's App**
    * The **WebSocket server** is subscribed to the real-time message broker.
    * Upon receiving the "driver matched" event, it uses the `rideId` to identify the correct rider's WebSocket connection.
    * It pushes the driver's details (name, photo, car info, license plate) and the driver's current location to the rider's app **in real time** via the open WebSocket connection.
    * The rider's app, receiving this update, instantly changes the UI from "Finding Driver..." to the driver's details and shows the driver's car moving on the map.

8.  **Driver Decline or Timeout**
    * If a driver declines or the request times out:
        * The **Driver Matching Worker** updates the driver's status in Redis back to `online`.
        * It moves on to the next driver in the list and repeats the notification process.

This flow eliminates the need for constant, wasteful polling by using a reactive, event-driven system where the server proactively informs the client about critical updates.
