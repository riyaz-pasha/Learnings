Sure! Here's a detailed **High-Level System Design (HLSD)** plan for a **Pastebin-like service** that supports pasting code/text, public/private links, expiry, storage, and scalability.

---

# 1. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements (Core Features)

* Users can paste code/text snippets.
* Each paste is assigned a unique URL.
* Support **public** and **private** pastes:

  * Public pastes can be accessed by anyone with the link.
  * Private pastes require some form of authentication or secret key.
* Support expiry of pastes (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 day, 1 week, never).
* Users can optionally delete their pastes.
* Support syntax highlighting for popular programming languages (optional frontend feature).
* Ability to search public pastes (optional / future).
* Track and limit paste sizes (e.g., max 1MB per paste).
* Provide analytics: number of views per paste (optional / future).

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability:** Handle millions of pastes and high QPS (queries per second).
* **Availability:** Highly available system with minimal downtime.
* **Performance:** Low latency for reads (retrieving pastes) and writes (creating pastes).
* **Durability:** No data loss, especially for pastes before expiry.
* **Security:**

  * Private pastes should be secure.
  * Prevent abuse (rate-limiting, spam detection).
* **Consistency:** Eventual consistency is acceptable; strong consistency for read-after-write is desirable for private pastes.
* **Cost-efficient:** Storage and bandwidth cost optimization.

### Assumptions

* Most traffic is **read-heavy** (people accessing pastes) compared to write-heavy (creating pastes).
* Users mostly share public pastes, but private pastes are also common.
* Expired pastes should be cleaned up automatically.
* No user accounts initially (anonymous pastes) — can add accounts later.

# 2. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation

| Metric             | Estimation & Assumptions                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of users    | 1 million total users, 100K daily active users (DAU)          |
| Write QPS          | 100 writes per second (new pastes created)                    |
| Read QPS           | 1,000 reads per second (10x read-to-write ratio)              |
| Average paste size | 10 KB (typical text/code snippet)                             |
| Storage per day    | 100 writes/sec \* 10 KB \* 86,400 sec/day ≈ 8.64 TB/day (raw) |
| Retention          | Many pastes expire within days, reducing long-term storage    |
| Bandwidth per day  | 1,000 reads/sec \* 10 KB \* 86,400 ≈ 864 GB/day               |

**Justification:**

* Read-heavy system since many people read shared pastes.
* Average paste size small but can vary, 10 KB is conservative.
* Expiry reduces long-term storage need.
* Estimate helps choose scalable storage and caching strategies.

                   +---------------+           +------------------+           +----------------+
```

### Components and Roles

* **Load Balancer:**

  * Distributes incoming requests evenly across API servers.
  * Handles health checks and failover.
  * Use Layer 7 HTTP load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX).
* **API Servers / Web Servers:**

  * Stateless services that handle business logic.
  * Handle paste creation, retrieval, deletion.
  * Validate expiry and privacy.
* **Cache Layer:**

  * Store hot pastes or frequently accessed public pastes.
  * Use Redis or Memcached.
  * Use CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to cache public pastes globally.
* **Application Database:**

  * Store paste metadata (ID, expiry, privacy, language).
  * Store small pastes directly or metadata referencing blob storage.
  * NoSQL DB (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra) for scalability or SQL DB with sharding.
* **Blob Storage:**

  * Store large paste content or raw text data.
  * Use object storage like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.

### Communication Protocols

* Client to API Server: RESTful HTTP(S)
* API Server to Cache/DB/Blob: HTTP/gRPC or native client libraries (e.g., Redis protocol, AWS SDK)

---

# 5. Component Deep Dive

### Data Storage

* **Choice:** NoSQL (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra, MongoDB) or distributed SQL (e.g., CockroachDB, Spanner).
* **Reason:** High write and read throughput, flexible schema, easy horizontal scaling.
* **Schema example:**

| Field          | Type        | Description                      |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| paste\_id      | String (PK) | Unique identifier                |
| content\_ref   | String      | Reference to blob storage object |
| language       | String      | Programming language for syntax  |
| is\_private    | Boolean     | Privacy flag                     |
| password\_hash | String      | Optional hashed password         |
| created\_at    | Timestamp   | Creation time                    |
| expires\_at    | Timestamp   | Expiry time                      |
| view\_count    | Integer     | (Optional) views count           |

* Store actual content in Blob Storage if size > threshold (e.g., >100KB), else inline in DB.
* **Sharding:** Partition by `paste_id` hash to distribute load evenly across nodes.

### Caching Strategy

* **Where:** At CDN level for public pastes, at Redis cache for frequently accessed pastes.
* **Strategy:** Write-through cache for public pastes to ensure reads get fresh data.
* Private pastes mostly read once or by owner, cache only with expiration.
* Use LRU eviction policy on Redis to keep hot data.

### Load Balancing

* **Placement:** Front of API servers.
* **Type:** Layer 7 HTTP Load balancer supporting sticky sessions if needed.
* **Algorithm:** Round Robin or Least Connections for distributing client requests.
* Health checks to remove unhealthy nodes dynamically.

---

# 6. Scalability and Availability

* **Horizontal Scalability:**

  * Stateless API servers allow easy horizontal scaling.
  * Distributed NoSQL or SQL DB scales via sharding/partitioning.
  * CDN caches reduce origin server load globally.
* **Availability:**

  * Deploy multiple API server instances across availability zones (AZ).
  * Use multi-AZ or multi-region DB replication.
  * Use multi-region CDN.
* **Failover & Redundancy:**

  * Automatic failover at load balancer level.
  * Replicated DB with automatic failover.
  * Blob storage is inherently durable and replicated.

---

# 7. Potential Bottlenecks and Trade-offs

### Bottlenecks

* Database writes during peak load.
* Large paste uploads can cause bandwidth spikes.
* Cache misses causing DB overload.
* Expiry cleanup may cause DB or cache overhead.

### Trade-offs

* **Consistency vs. Availability:** Eventual consistency preferred for scalability; slight delays acceptable for public pastes.
* **Read-heavy optimization:** CDN + caching improves read performance but adds complexity.
* **Storage cost vs. speed:** Storing large pastes in blob storage reduces DB load but adds retrieval latency.
* **Private pastes security vs. convenience:** Passwords or tokens add security but require additional validation.

### Future Improvements

* User accounts with authentication.
* Search functionality over public pastes.
* Paste versioning.
* Analytics dashboard.
* Advanced syntax highlighting on frontend.
* Rate limiting and abuse detection.
* Multi-region deployment for global low latency.

Great question! Let me walk you through the **step-by-step flow** of what happens internally when a user **creates a paste** in the Pastebin-like system, which components get involved, and what challenges can arise.

---

# What Happens When a User Creates a Paste?

### Step 1: Client Sends Create Paste Request

* User enters or pastes their code/text snippet in the frontend UI.
* User selects options: public/private, expiry time, optional password.
* Client sends a **POST /api/pastes** request with the paste content and metadata (privacy, expiry, language, etc.) to the backend API endpoint over **HTTPS**.

---

### Step 2: Request Reaches Load Balancer

* The **Load Balancer** receives the incoming HTTP request.
* It selects a healthy API server instance (using Round Robin or Least Connections).
* Forwards the request to that API server.

---

### Step 3: API Server Validates Input & Handles Business Logic

* API server authenticates (if private paste with password) or verifies input.
* Validates paste size limits.
* Checks expiry time validity.
* Generates a **unique paste ID** (e.g., base62 encoded UUID or hash).
* Optionally hashes the password if paste is private.
* Determines whether content size fits in DB or should be stored in Blob Storage.

---

### Step 4: Paste Content Storage

* If content size ≤ threshold (e.g., 100KB):

  * Store paste content inline in the database record.
* Else:

  * Upload paste content to **Blob Storage** (e.g., AWS S3).
  * Store the blob object key or URL in the database as `content_ref`.

---

### Step 5: Paste Metadata Storage in Database

* Create a new database record with:

  * `paste_id`
  * `content` (or `content_ref`)
  * `language`
  * `is_private`
  * `password_hash` (if private)
  * `created_at`
  * `expires_at`
* Write to the **database** (NoSQL or SQL) with appropriate sharding/partitioning based on `paste_id`.

---

### Step 6: Cache Invalidation/Update (optional)

* If caching is used for pastes, update or invalidate cache for this new paste.
* For public pastes, may preload cache or CDN with new paste data.

---

### Step 7: Response to Client

* API server returns response with:

  * The unique `paste_id`.
  * The full URL for accessing the paste.
* Client displays the URL to the user.

# Challenges & Potential Issues

### 1. Unique Paste ID Generation

* **Challenge:** Generating unique, short, URL-safe paste IDs without collisions.
* **Solution:** Use UUIDs encoded in Base62, or snowflake IDs, or distributed ID generators with low collision risk.

### 2. Large Paste Uploads

* **Challenge:** Large pastes (>1MB) can cause bandwidth spikes, slow DB writes.
* **Solution:** Limit max paste size, offload content to Blob Storage, support chunked uploads.

### 3. Data Consistency & Latency

* **Challenge:** Writes need to be durable and consistent; users expect immediate access after creation.
* **Solution:** Strong consistency or read-after-write consistency for private pastes; eventual consistency may be acceptable for public pastes with cache warming.

### 4. Expiry Handling

* **Challenge:** Expiry logic may cause stale data if not cleaned promptly.
* **Solution:** Use TTL features in DB (e.g., DynamoDB TTL) or scheduled background jobs to remove expired pastes.

### 5. Security for Private Pastes

* **Challenge:** Storing passwords securely; preventing unauthorized access.
* **Solution:** Hash passwords with strong algorithms (bcrypt), secure access tokens or authorization, HTTPS everywhere.

### 6. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

* **Challenge:** Prevent spam or DDoS attacks from bots submitting many pastes.
* **Solution:** Rate limit API requests per IP, implement CAPTCHA, and monitor suspicious patterns.

### 7. Handling Failures

* **Challenge:** Partial failures during storage (e.g., Blob upload succeeds but DB write fails).
* **Solution:** Implement transactional behavior or compensating actions (delete blob if DB insert fails), retry logic.

---

# What Happens When a User Reads a Paste?

### Step 1: Client Sends Read Request

* User visits a URL like `https://pastebin.com/{paste_id}`.
* Browser or client sends a **GET /api/pastes/{paste\_id}** request to backend API.

---

### Step 2: Request Reaches Load Balancer

* The Load Balancer receives the request.
* It forwards the request to a healthy API server instance.

---

### Step 3: API Server Checks Cache (Hot Path)

* The API server first checks the **cache layer** (Redis or CDN cache) to see if the paste content and metadata are cached.

  * **Cache hit:** Serve directly from cache → fast response.
  * **Cache miss:** Proceed to fetch from persistent storage.

---

### Step 4: API Server Queries Database / Blob Storage

* API server queries the **database** for paste metadata using `paste_id`.
* Checks:

  * If paste exists.
  * If paste has expired (compare current time to `expires_at`).
  * If paste is private:

    * Validate access credentials (password/token).
* If paste content is stored inline in DB → retrieve it.
* Else, use `content_ref` to fetch content from **Blob Storage**.

---

### Step 5: Return Paste Content

* API server returns paste content and metadata to client.
* For public pastes, cache the paste content in Redis or let CDN cache it for faster future reads.

---

### Step 6: Optional Analytics Update

* Increment view count or analytics counters asynchronously (e.g., via a message queue).

# Components Involved in Reading a Paste

| Step                        | Component                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Request routing             | Load Balancer                       |
| Cache lookup                | Redis cache or CDN                  |
| Metadata & content fetch    | Database + Blob Storage             |
| Authentication (if private) | API Server                          |
| Response to client          | API Server → Load Balancer → Client |

---

# Challenges During Reading

* Cache misses causing DB or blob storage load spikes.
* Ensuring private pastes are securely accessed.
* Handling expired pastes gracefully.
* Latency from Blob storage retrieval if content is large.

---

# How Expiry Cleanup Works?

### Goal

* Remove expired pastes to free up storage and avoid serving stale data.

---

### Two Approaches to Expiry Cleanup

#### 1. TTL-based Automatic Expiry (Preferred)

* Use **Database TTL (Time-To-Live)** features.
* Many NoSQL DBs (e.g., DynamoDB, MongoDB) support automatic deletion of records after expiry timestamp.
* For Blob Storage, implement lifecycle policies to delete objects after expiry.
* Pros:

  * Fully automatic.
  * No extra background job overhead.
* Cons:

  * Some delay in actual deletion (depending on DB).

#### 2. Scheduled Cleanup Job (Background Worker)

* Run periodic batch jobs (e.g., every hour or day).
* Query DB for pastes where `expires_at < current_time`.
* Delete expired pastes metadata from DB.
* Delete associated content from Blob Storage if applicable.
* Remove from cache.
* Pros:

  * Precise control over cleanup timing.
  * Can handle complex cleanup logic.
* Cons:

  * Requires extra infrastructure and monitoring.

---

### Challenges in Expiry Cleanup

* Avoid race conditions where a paste is read just before deletion.
* Consistency between DB and Blob Storage deletion.
* Ensuring cache invalidation after paste expires.
* Handling large-scale cleanup efficiently without performance degradation.
