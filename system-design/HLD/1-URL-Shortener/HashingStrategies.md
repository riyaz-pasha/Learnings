let’s dig into **slug generation** for a high-scale URL shortener.
We’ll go deep into the **hashing strategies**, trade-offs, collision handling, and performance/security considerations.

---

## 1. The goals of slug generation

A good slug generation strategy should:

1. **Be short** – so links are human-friendly.
2. **Be unique** – no collisions unless intentionally reused.
3. **Be fast to generate** – sub-millisecond latency at scale.
4. **Be hard to guess** (optional) – if you want unlisted/private links.
5. **Support custom aliases** – without breaking uniqueness.
6. **Scale without coordination** – avoid central bottlenecks.

---

## 2. Categories of strategies

### A) **Hash-based (Deterministic)**

You take some input (the long URL, metadata) and hash it.

**Example:**

```text
slug = Base62( first_k_bits( SHA256(long_url) ) )
```

* **Advantages:**

  * Same long URL → same slug (if you want idempotence).
  * Easy to generate without DB round trip.
  * No global counter needed.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Collisions possible when truncating the hash.
  * If length is short, collisions rise quickly.
  * Predictable unless salted.

**Collision handling:**

* Store in DB; if collision occurs, try next k bits or append salt.
* Use a **hash + random salt** to make guessing harder.

**Best for:**

* Stateless generation in multiple regions.
* Use with collision-resolving logic.

---

### B) **Sequential ID Encoding**

You use an auto-incrementing integer ID (from DB or distributed ID generator), then encode to base62/base36.

**Example:**

```text
id = next_id()  # from DB, Snowflake, etc.
slug = Base62(id)
```

* **Advantages:**

  * Guaranteed uniqueness.
  * Very short slugs at first (ID=1 → "1").
  * Simple decoding to an integer if needed.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Requires coordination to avoid duplicate IDs across regions.
  * Predictable sequence unless obfuscated.

**Best for:**

* Centralized write path or distributed ID generators (Snowflake, KSUID).

---

### C) **Random (Non-deterministic)**

You generate a random string of characters from your alphabet.

**Example:**

```text
slug = random_base62(length=7)
```

* **Advantages:**

  * No predictability if using CSPRNG.
  * No need to store mapping ahead of time (check only on collision).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Collision probability rises with traffic (Birthday paradox).
  * Requires DB check on insert.

**Collision math example:**
If using base62 (62^7 ≈ 3.52 trillion combinations),
at 1 billion URLs stored, collision probability ≈ 0.014% — quite safe.

**Best for:**

* Privacy-focused shorteners.
* Easy multi-region scaling.

---

### D) **Hybrid**

You combine deterministic ID generation with a layer of obfuscation.

**Example:**

```text
slug = Base62( id ^ secret_mask )
```

or

```text
slug = Base62( hash(id + secret_salt) )
```

* **Advantages:**

  * Keeps uniqueness from sequential IDs.
  * Removes predictability of pure sequential.
  * Can embed info (time, region ID) inside slug.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Slightly more complexity.
  * Must manage secret keys/masks.

---

## 3. Slug length & alphabet choice

* **Alphabet:** Base62 (0–9, A–Z, a–z) is common.

  * 62^6 ≈ 56.8B possibilities.
  * 62^7 ≈ 3.52T possibilities.
  * 62^8 ≈ 218T possibilities.
* **Trade-off:** shorter slugs → higher collision risk.
* **Security:**

  * If you want unguessable links, target entropy ≥ 64 bits.
    That’s \~11 random base62 chars (`62^11 ≈ 5.2e19`).

---

## 4. Multi-region scaling considerations

If you want **globally unique slugs** without a single bottleneck:

1. **Hash-based**: Works naturally — just ensure consistent alphabet & truncation.
2. **Sequential ID**: Use distributed ID generators like:

   * **Twitter Snowflake**: 64-bit IDs with timestamp + machine ID + sequence.
   * **ULID**: 128-bit, time-sortable, base32 encoded.
   * **KSUID**: 160-bit, time-sortable, base62 encoded.
3. **Random**: Generate locally using CSPRNG; collisions low if length is enough.

---

## 5. Collision resolution patterns

* **Pre-check (synchronous)**: Try insert; if unique constraint fails, regenerate and retry.
* **Append disambiguator**: If collision, append a random char or number.
* **Versioning**: Store multiple slugs for same long URL.

---

## 6. Security & Abuse prevention

* If shortener is public:

  * Use unguessable slugs for private links → at least 8–10 chars random base62.
  * Rate-limit slug creation to prevent enumeration abuse.
  * For open redirect prevention: validate domains if needed.

---

## 7. Example strategies by use case

| Use case                | Recommended method              | Length   | Notes                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Public free shortener   | Random base62 + collision check | 7–8      | Good privacy, low collision risk |
| Internal tool           | Sequential ID + base62          | 5–6      | Simple, predictable fine         |
| Marketing campaigns     | Custom human-readable slugs     | Variable | Reserve namespace                |
| High-scale multi-region | Snowflake ID → base62           | 8–10     | No coordination, sortable        |
| Private sharing         | CSPRNG base62 (≥ 64 bits)       | 11+      | Unguessable                      |

How to make **Sequential Numeric ID + Base62 encoding** work correctly when the system is sharded across multiple DBs.
The main challenge: **ensuring uniqueness** without a single central “auto-increment” counter.

---

## 1. Why this is tricky

If you just let each DB shard auto-increment IDs independently, they’ll overlap:

```text
Shard A: 1, 2, 3, ...
Shard B: 1, 2, 3, ...
```

→ Collisions in Base62 slugs.

We need to design ID generation so **each shard generates a disjoint range of numbers**.

---

## 2. Common Solutions

### **A) Pre-allocated ID ranges per shard**

Each shard is assigned its own numeric range, so IDs never collide.

**Example:**

* Shard 0: IDs 0 → 999,999,999
* Shard 1: IDs 1,000,000,000 → 1,999,999,999
* Shard 2: IDs 2,000,000,000 → 2,999,999,999

**Pros:**

* Very simple logic.
* No coordination after initial range assignment.
* Works with standard `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

**Cons:**

* Risk of one shard exhausting its range earlier than others.
* Requires careful capacity planning.

---

### **B) AUTO\_INCREMENT offset + increment trick**

MySQL/PostgreSQL can be configured so each shard has a different start value and step size.

**Example (3 shards):**

* Shard 0: `AUTO_INCREMENT = 1, INCREMENT = 3` → IDs: 1, 4, 7, 10, …
* Shard 1: `AUTO_INCREMENT = 2, INCREMENT = 3` → IDs: 2, 5, 8, 11, …
* Shard 2: `AUTO_INCREMENT = 3, INCREMENT = 3` → IDs: 3, 6, 9, 12, …

**Pros:**

* No central coordinator.
* Works forever, no range exhaustion.
* Still globally unique IDs.

**Cons:**

* IDs are not contiguous globally.
* Slightly longer Base62 encoding at smaller scales.

---

### **C) Distributed ID generators (Snowflake, etc.)**

Instead of relying on DB to generate IDs, use an **external service** that hands out unique IDs.

**Example:**
Snowflake ID format (64-bit):

```
[Timestamp bits][Shard ID bits][Sequence bits]
```

* Timestamp ensures ordering.
* Shard ID ensures uniqueness across shards.
* Sequence increments for multiple IDs per millisecond.

**Pros:**

* No DB coordination at all.
* Time-sortable IDs.
* Can encode region/shard info.

**Cons:**

* Slightly more complex infrastructure (extra service to maintain).
* Need strong clock sync (e.g., NTP).

---

### **D) Centralized ID allocation service**

One service hands out IDs to all app servers, regardless of shard.

**Pros:**

* Very easy to reason about.
* Sequential IDs across the system.

**Cons:**

* Single point of failure unless highly available.
* Extra network hop per write.

---

## 3. Encoding to Base62

Once you have a globally unique integer:

```python
def base62_encode(num):
    alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    result = []
    while num > 0:
        num, rem = divmod(num, 62)
        result.append(alphabet[rem])
    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

**Shard-awareness:**
If you want to decode later and know which shard to hit, you can embed the **shard ID in the integer** before encoding:

```
global_id = (shard_id << N) | local_counter
slug = base62_encode(global_id)
```

This way:

* The shard ID is always in the upper bits.
* You can reverse the encoding to find which DB holds the row.

---

## 4. Recommended Design for Multi-Shard Sequential Base62

For large-scale systems, I recommend:

* **ID Generation:** Snowflake-like service

  ```
  [41 bits timestamp][10 bits shard ID][12 bits sequence]
  ```

  → 2^12 IDs/ms/shard, up to 1024 shards.
* **Slug Length:** 7–8 chars Base62 for near-term scale, grows slowly over time.
* **Shard Routing:** Store mapping of shard\_id → DB connection.
* **Failover:** Multiple ID generator nodes per region.

---

Let’s walk through **exactly** what the request path looks like in a **multi-shard + sequential ID + Base62** setup, including slug → shard resolution.

We’ll do it step-by-step for both **writes** (short URL creation) and **reads** (short URL expansion).

---

## **1. Shard Splitting Strategy**

We have two main approaches:

### **A) Shard ID embedded in slug** ✅ (recommended here)

* During ID generation, we **embed the shard ID into the numeric ID** before Base62 encoding.
* Example:

  ```
  global_id = (shard_id << 48) | local_counter
  slug = base62_encode(global_id)
  ```
* When decoding the slug, we reverse the Base62 to integer, extract `shard_id`, and route request there.
* No need for external lookups or consistent hashing for reads.
* Read path is O(1) — purely arithmetic.

---

### **B) Consistent Hashing (no shard ID in slug)**

* We hash the slug string (or numeric ID) and map it to a shard using **consistent hashing**.
* Same hashing logic on writes and reads.
* Slightly slower on reads (hash computation + shard map lookup).
* Useful if you want to hide shard IDs in slugs completely.

---

## **2. Write Request Flow (Create Short URL)**

**Example:** User requests shortening `https://example.com/page`

### Steps:

1. **API Gateway** receives request: `POST /shorten`
2. **App Server** calls **ID Generator**:

   * ID generator assigns:

     ```
     timestamp = now()
     shard_id = pick_shard_for_this_write()  // e.g., round-robin or hash user ID
     local_counter = shard-specific sequence
     global_id = (shard_id << 48) | local_counter
     ```
3. Encode `global_id` to **Base62 slug** → `abc123`
4. Insert into correct **DB shard**:

   ```
   shard_id → DB connection from shard map
   INSERT INTO urls (id, long_url, created_at) VALUES (global_id, 'https://example.com/page', NOW())
   ```
5. Return JSON:

   ```json
   { "short_url": "https://sho.rt/abc123" }
   ```

---

## **3. Read Request Flow (Expand Short URL)**

**Example:** User visits `https://sho.rt/abc123`

### Steps:

1. **API Gateway** receives request: `GET /abc123`
2. **App Server**:

   * Decode `abc123` from Base62 → `global_id`
   * Extract shard:

     ```
     shard_id = (global_id >> 48) & shard_mask
     ```
   * Use shard\_id → DB connection from shard map
3. Query shard:

   ```
   SELECT long_url FROM urls WHERE id = global_id
   ```
4. Redirect user to `long_url`.

---

## **4. Example Shard Mapping**

If we have **8 shards**:

```
shard_id 0 → DB0: 10.0.1.1
shard_id 1 → DB1: 10.0.1.2
...
shard_id 7 → DB7: 10.0.1.8
```

Stored in:

* In-memory config on app servers (updated from config service)
* Or a central service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul)

---

## **5. Why Shard ID in Slug Beats Consistent Hashing**

| Feature                  | Shard ID in Slug       | Consistent Hashing |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Lookup speed             | O(1) bitmask           | O(1) hash + map    |
| External service needed? | No                     | No                 |
| Slug decodable to shard  | Yes                    | No                 |
| Hides shard layout       | No (unless obfuscated) | Yes                |
| Rebalancing shards       | Requires remap         | Easier (hashing)   |

If you expect **frequent shard rebalancing**, consistent hashing may be better.
If you want **maximum read speed**, embed shard ID in slug.

## **6. ASCII Diagram of Request Paths**

**Write Path (shorten)**:

```
Client → LB → App Server → ID Generator
        → [determine shard_id] → DB Shard #N (insert)
        → Response with slug
```

**Read Path (expand)**:

```
Client → LB → App Server
        → [decode Base62 → shard_id] → DB Shard #N (select)
        → Return long URL / redirect
```
