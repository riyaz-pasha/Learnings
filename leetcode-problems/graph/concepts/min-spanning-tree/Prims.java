/*
 * Primâ€™s Algorithm - Step-by-Step Explanation
 *
 * Goal:
 *   - Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, weighted graph.
 *   - MST connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight and no cycles.
 *
 * Step 1: Initialize
 *   - Create a `minHeap` (priority queue) to always pick the edge with the smallest weight.
 *   - Create a `visited[]` array to track included vertices in the MST.
 *   - Start from an arbitrary node (e.g., vertex 0):
 *       - Push all edges from this vertex into the `minHeap`.
 *
 * Step 2: Build MST using Priority Queue
 *   - While `minHeap` is not empty and MST is incomplete:
 *       a) Extract the minimum weight edge from the heap.
 *       b) If the destination vertex is already visited, skip it.
 *       c) Else:
 *           - Include the edge in the MST.
 *           - Mark the destination vertex as visited.
 *           - Push all adjacent edges of the new vertex (to unvisited neighbors) into the heap.
 *
 * Step 3: Output
 *   - After all vertices are visited (MST has V - 1 edges):
 *       - Print the edges of the MST.
 *       - Print the total weight.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(E log V)
 *   - E = number of edges, V = number of vertices
 *   - PriorityQueue operations are log V
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E)
 *   - For visited[], priority queue, and adjacency list
 *
 * Pros:
 *   - Efficient for dense graphs when implemented with a min-heap
 *   - Builds MST incrementally from any starting node
 *
 * Cons:
 *   - Requires a priority queue and adjacency list representation
 *   - Slightly more complex than Kruskal for edge-based logic
