/*
 * Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’, which
 * contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X-axis. You
 * are also given an integer ‘k’. You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the
 * X-axis. You can place them anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis,
 * even on non-integer positions. Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the
 * distance between adjacent gas stations after adding k new gas stations.
 * Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.
 * 
 * Note: Answers within 10^-6 of the actual answer will be accepted. For
 * example, if the actual answer is 0.65421678124, it is okay to return
 * 0.654216. Our answer will be accepted if that is the same as the actual
 * answer up to the 6th decimal place.
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k = 4
 * Result: 0.5
 * Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 4 gas stations is
 * {1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas
 * stations is 0.5. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 0.5. It can be shown that
 * there is no possible way to add 4 gas stations in such a way that the value
 * of ‘dist’ is lower than this.
 * Example 2:
 * Input Format: N = 10, arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, k = 1
 * Result: 1
 * Explanation: One of the possible ways to place 1 gas station is
 * {1,1.5,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas
 * stations is still 1. Hence, the value of ‘dist’ is 1. It can be shown that
 * there is no possible way to add 1 gas station in such a way that the value of
 * ‘dist’ is lower than this.

/*
 * DETAILED EXPLANATION:
 * 
 * BRUTE FORCE APPROACH:
 * 1. Use an array howMany[] to track stations between each pair of consecutive
 * original stations
 * 2. For each of k stations to place:
 * - Find the section with maximum current distance
 * - Place one station in that section (increment howMany[i])
 * 3. After placing all stations, find the maximum distance
 * 4. Time: O(k*n), Space: O(n)
 * 
 * BETTER APPROACH (Priority Queue):
 * 1. Use a max heap to always get the section with maximum distance
 * 2. Initially add all gaps to the heap
 * 3. For each station to place:
 * - Extract section with max distance
 * - Place station there (update count)
 * - Recalculate new distance and add back to heap
 * 4. Time: O(n log n + k log n), Space: O(n)
 * 
 * OPTIMAL APPROACH (Binary Search):
 * 1. Binary search on the answer (maximum distance)
 * 2. Search range: [0, maximum_initial_gap]
 * 3. For each mid value, check if it's achievable:
 * - For each gap, calculate stations needed: floor(gap_length / mid)
 * - If total stations needed <= k, mid is achievable
 * 4. Find minimum achievable maximum distance
 * 5. Time: O(n * log(range)), Space: O(1)
 * 
 * KEY INSIGHT for Binary Search:
 * - If we can achieve maximum distance 'd', we can also achieve any distance >
 * d
 * - This monotonic property allows binary search
 * - We're searching for the minimum value of maximum distance
 * 
 * The optimal approach is most efficient for large inputs!
