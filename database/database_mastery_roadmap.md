# 🧠 Database Mastery Roadmap – From Basics to Expert

---

## ✅ Stage 1: Solidify the Basics

### 📌 Concepts
- [ ] Data modeling (ER diagrams, normalization/denormalization)
- [ ] Understanding data types (numeric, string, date, JSON, etc.)
- [ ] Primary, Foreign Keys, Unique Constraints
- [ ] Indexes (B-Tree, Hash, Composite, Covering)
- [ ] SQL Essentials (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- [ ] Window Functions and CTEs
- [ ] Transactions & ACID properties
- [ ] Basic Query Optimization (EXPLAIN, LIMIT, indexing)

### 🛠️ Practice
- [ ] Build a simple blog/e-commerce system using PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- [ ] Optimize slow SQL queries using `EXPLAIN`

---

## 🔄 Stage 2: Intermediate Concepts

### 📌 Concepts
- [ ] Transaction Isolation Levels (Read Uncommitted to Serializable)
- [ ] MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
- [ ] Locking (Row-level, Table-level, Optimistic vs Pessimistic)
- [ ] Join Algorithms (Nested Loop, Merge, Hash Join)
- [ ] SQL Execution Flow (Parsing → Planning → Optimization → Execution)

### 🛠️ Practice
- [ ] Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on real queries
- [ ] Simulate race conditions and test locking strategies

---

## ⚙️ Stage 3: Database Internals

### 📌 Concepts
- [ ] Storage Engine: Pages, Segments, Tuples, Tablespaces
- [ ] Buffer Pool / Cache Management
- [ ] WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
- [ ] Checkpointing and Crash Recovery
- [ ] Index Internals (B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST)
- [ ] Query Planner and Optimizer Internals

### 🛠️ Practice
- [ ] Read PostgreSQL or SQLite source code
- [ ] Build a minimal key-value store in-memory

---

## 🧬 Stage 4: Advanced Topics

### 📌 Concepts
- [ ] Sharding and Partitioning (horizontal/vertical)
- [ ] Replication Strategies (Leader-Follower, Multi-Leader)
- [ ] Consensus Algorithms (Raft, Paxos basics)
- [ ] CAP Theorem & PACELC
- [ ] Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency
- [ ] OLTP vs OLAP
- [ ] Columnar vs Row-oriented Storage
- [ ] Vectorized Execution

### 🛠️ Practice
- [ ] Set up a sharded PostgreSQL/MongoDB cluster
- [ ] Use Apache Druid or ClickHouse for analytics use cases

---

## 🚀 Stage 5: Modern & Niche Systems

### 📌 Concepts
- [ ] NewSQL Databases (CockroachDB, YugabyteDB)
- [ ] Vector Databases (Pinecone, FAISS)
- [ ] Time-Series Databases (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB)
- [ ] Graph Databases (Neo4j, DGraph)
- [ ] DBaaS Internals (RDS, Aurora, PlanetScale)

### 🛠️ Practice
- [ ] Build a small graph-based recommendation engine
- [ ] Compare time-series DBs for sensor data
